          <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Aeterna Events ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website at aeternaevents.com. This policy should be read alongside our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

          <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
          <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) when you visit a website. They help websites remember your preferences and improve your browsing experience. Cookies can be "session" cookies (which are deleted when you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (which remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them).</p>

          <h2>2. Cookies We Use</h2>
          <p>Our website uses a minimal number of cookies. We do not use analytics cookies, advertising cookies, or tracking pixels. Below is a detailed list of the cookies used on our website:</p>

          <table>

                <th>Cookie Name</th>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
                <th>Duration</th>

          <h2>3. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
          <p>Our website loads fonts from Google Fonts. When you visit our site, your browser makes requests to Google's servers to load these fonts. Google may set cookies or collect information such as:</p>

          <h2>4. Cookies We Do NOT Use</h2>

          <h2>5. Local Storage</h2>
          <p>In addition to cookies, we use your browser's local storage to remember your cookie consent preference. Local storage is similar to cookies but allows for larger amounts of data to be stored. The data stored in local storage:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is only accessible by our website</li>
            <li>Is not sent to our servers</li>
            <li>Remains until you clear your browser data</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. Managing Cookies</h2>
          <p>You have several options to manage cookies:</p>

          <h3>Browser Settings</h3>
          <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can typically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>View cookies stored on your device</li>
            <li>Delete all or specific cookies</li>
            <li>Block cookies from all or specific websites</li>
            <li>Set your browser to notify you when a cookie is set</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here are links to cookie management instructions for popular browsers:</p>
          <ul>

            <li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>

          <h3>Impact of Disabling Cookies</h3>

            <li><strong>Non-essential cookies</strong> require your consent before being set. We do not use non-essential cookies.</li>
          </ul>
