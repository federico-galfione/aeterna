          "question": "What does the venue finding service cost?",

          "question": "How far in advance should I start?",
          "answer": "For weddings, we recommend starting 12-18 months ahead, especially for popular regions and dates. Corporate retreats typically need 3-6 months lead time, though we can work with shorter timelines when needed."

          "question": "Do you only work with venues in certain regions?",

        {
          "question": "Do you provide full event planning?",
          "answer": "Our core service is venue finding. Once you've secured your venue, we can recommend trusted local planners, caterers, and vendors if you need full event coordination. Many venues also offer their own event management services."
